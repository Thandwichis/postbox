2. **Database and Server Issues**: The user encountered problems with database connections and server configurations. This included PostgreSQL connection issues and Rails server start-up problems.

3. **Implementing Features in the App**:
   - **Cents and Stamps**: The concept of "Cents" as a currency and "Stamps" as a means to send letters was developed. The user worked on displaying these values in the app's header and handling the database schema to support these features.

   - **Shipping Tracking Page**: The user aimed to create a page to track the shipping of letters with a live countdown.

4. **Frontend and Styling Issues**: The conversation involved troubleshooting issues with CSS not being applied, setting up a rich text editor (initially Trix, then attempted CKEditor), and configuring JavaScript files.

5. **Debugging and Error Resolution**: Various errors were debugged throughout the development process, including ActionView template errors, missing file errors, and Rails server issues.

6. **Miscellaneous Tasks**: The user also worked on smaller tasks like creating a `todo.txt` file and handling browser lag due to the lengthy conversation.

This conversation is a comprehensive guide through the development and troubleshooting process of specific features in a Ruby on Rails application.
